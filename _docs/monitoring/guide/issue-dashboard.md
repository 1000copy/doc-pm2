# Issue dashboard
 
You can track all exceptions that happens on your servers along with:
- stack trace
- line code number
- logs before exception

The issue dashboard primarily reports all the uncaught exceptions. When happening, node.js process crashes and pm2 automatically restarts the application while emiting an exception.

## Manually emit an issue

If you properly uses `try... catch` in your code, errors will be catch and will never be reported in the dashboard. 

To reporte them anyway, emit yourself an exception with `pmx.notify()`:

```javascript
const pmx = require('pmx')

try {
    // Critical action to be tested
}
catch(error) {
    // Your code in case of an exception
    pmx.notify(new Error('This is an error'))
}
```

## Express.js middleware

By default, express catches all exceptions that happen.

You need to add the PMX middleware if you want them to be reported:

```javascript
// all your routes here
// app.get((req, res) => {})
app.use(pmx.expressErrorHandler())
```

?> Use it after the routes declaration.
