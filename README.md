```bash
npm i docsify-cli -g
yarn dev
```
#### Phase 1
Getting to know how things implemented in docsify (header, sidebar, navigation)

#### Phase 2
Working on the structure of the site using Jekyll:
- make the visual of the site basic and progress towards final state.
- using Gulp.js as simple as possible at this state.
(required: gulp-sass, plumber, sourcemaps,browser-sync, concat)
(next to be added: uncss, imagemin(optional), newer, autoprefixer, rename)


Things to be considered :
- Using collection / tags

#### Phase 3
Refining the site (basic SEO, bugs hunting, finalize gulp)
