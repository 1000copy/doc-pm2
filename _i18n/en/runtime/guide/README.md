## Terminology

Before starting, some terminology we use across this guide:

A **daemon** is a program that is run as a background process. pm2 in essence is a daemon: always alive in the background, it takes care of all your processes, keeping them alive. Also, all your applications started with pm2 are daemonized.

The **process list** is where all your applications along with options and environment are registered. This list simply contains all the processes pm2 has started.
