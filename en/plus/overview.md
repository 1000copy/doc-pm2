# Overview

Why monitor your app with pm2 ? At the end of this PM2 Plus overview, you'll have a good understanding of the capabilities of PM2 Plus.

## Global Dashboard

### Unified Overview

PM2 Plus allows you to have an extended view of all your apps and databases in one single place, at real-time or through history. **Stop ssh in all your servers one by one**, instead, save time by having a condensed infrastructure plus view.

### Custom Metrics

Expose the important variables from your Node.js applications source code and display them as performance metrics on the pm2 plus dashboard. **Monitor values that matter.**

![custom metrics]({{site.baseurl}}{% link img/plus/personalized.png %})

### Notifications

Know when a data reaches a threshold, when an error occurred in your application or when your production application is down.

Even though pm2 process-manager makes sure that your application have no downtime, be notified in these critical situation in order to react. **Be notified and reactive in any critical situations.**

## Debug & Optimize

### Issue Dashboard

PM2 Plus reports the list of all errors in the "Issue Dashboard" occurred in your Node.js and gets you notified.

Stop spending time finding bugs or trying to replay them, we provide you an "Issue Dashboard" with everything in one place, to make debugging easier. **Drill down in your code and get the answer.**

### Transaction Tracing

Record and aggregate the database and external calls that your application makes on every http request.

The "Transaction Tracing" helps you troubleshoot performance issues and to get detailed low-level insight into how your app is working (slowest routes, most consuming, number of calls). **Provide a better user experience and make your app faster.**

### Memory & CPU profiling

Take memory dumps and CPU snapshots straight from your production servers.

**Memory profiling lets you find any memory leaks in your application. CPU profiling helps you identify particular resource-heavy tasks.**

## Extra-features

### Remote control

PM2 Plus makes possible to enhance custom functions in the source code of your application.

 For example, you can assign values to your application variables or just switch it to maintenance mode. In other words you can **expose triggerable functions in your code**.

![remote action]({{site.baseurl}}{% link img/plus/remote.png %})

### Event Dashboard

This mechanism allows you to track important events that occurred in your code. You can gather large amounts of data for statistics or just log unusual event.

For example your can track and be alerted when a new user has registered, a new email has been sent, a worker has finished its jobs. **You can emit any event directly from your code and subscribe to some of these.**

### Third-party modules

Extend the capabilities of the PM2 dashboard by using external modules listed in our module page.

A Pm2 module can be a log rotation module, database monitoring module, a standalone http proxy, a load balancer, a DNS server or any kind of utility. **Anyone can create and publish its own module.**
