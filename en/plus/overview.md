# Overview

Why monitor your app with PM2 Plus ? At the end of this overview, you'll have a better understanding of the capabilities of monitoring your app with PM2 Plus.

## Global Dashboard

### Unified Overview

Keymetrics allows you to have an extended view of all your apps and databases in one single place, at real-time or through history. **Stop ssh in all your servers one by one**, instead, save time by having a condensed infrastructure plus view.

### Custom Metrics

Expose the important variables from your Node.js applications source code and display them as performance metrics on the PM2 Plus dashboard. **Monitor values that matter.**

### Notifications

Know when a data reaches a threshold, when an error occurred in your application or when your production application is down.

Even though PM2 makes sure that your application have no downtime, be notified in these critical situation in order to react. **Be notified and reactive in any critical situations.**

## Debug & Optimize

### Issue Dashboard

Keymetrics reports the list of all errors in the "Issue Dashboard" occurred in your Node.js and gets you notified.

Stop spending time finding bugs or trying to replay them, we provide you an "Issue Dashboard" with everything in one place, to make debugging easier. **Drill down in your code and get the answer.**

### Transaction Tracing

Record and aggregate the database and external calls that your application makes on every http request.

The "Transaction Tracing" helps you troubleshoot performance issues and to get detailed low-level insight into how your app is working (slowest routes, most consuming, number of calls). **Provide a better user experience and make your app faster.**

### Memory & CPU Profiling

Take memory dumps and CPU snapshots straight from your production servers.

**Memory profiling lets you find any memory leaks in your application. CPU profiling helps you identify particular resource-heavy tasks.**

## Extra-features

### Remote control

Keymetrics makes possible to enhance custom functions in the source code of your application.

For example, you can assign values to your application variables or just switch it to maintenance mode. In other words you can **expose triggerable functions in your code**.

### Third-party modules

Extend the capabilities of the PM2 Plus dashboard by using external modules listed in our module page.

**Anyone can create and publish its own module.**
