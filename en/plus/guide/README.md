## Terminology

Let's explain some terminology we use across this guide:

A **bucket** is an entity that we use to gather multiple servers. A bucket is generally used to gather multiple server from a single project.

A **server** is an entity from which Keymetrics receive informations from one or more processes.

A **process** is an entity of the process list (`pm2 ls`).
